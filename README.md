OpenWeather 16 Day Forecast for Desktop and Mobile

Using Ruby 2.5.0 on Rails, build an application that accesses the 5 Day forecast from OpenWeather’s API and displays the 5 Day forecast to the user. The documentation for OpenWeather’s 5 Day forecast API can be found here https://openweathermap.org/forecast5

Note: This free portion of OpenWeather’s API has a call limit of 60 calls per minute.
API Key: e1e8745a9feec7cd789b6d2c05503d79

The only core function of the application is to render a single view containing Phoenix Arizona’s 5 Day forecast.
single view using Pheonix Arizona, 5 day

Since this application will run on Desktop and Mobile browsers, make sure to implement a responsive view. Construct the Desktop and Mobile layouts of your view in a way that you feel provides the best user experience.

The resulting application should open in Safari Mobile, Safari Desktop, Chrome Mobile, or Chrome Desktop, and show one view containing OpenWeather’s 5 Day forecast for Phoenix Arizona.
